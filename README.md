Databases Coursework
"Angel Kanchev" University of Ruse

In this project, we used the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, which includes dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.2/BLE, faster Ethernet, and Power-over-Ethernet support. We set it up by connecting a mouse, keyboard, HDMI cable, and power supply. The Raspbian OS was installed on an SD card, allowing us to control sensors and LEDs via the GPIO pins. Using Python, we read data from BME280 and BH1750 sensors and managed LEDs, displaying the data on a website. The front-end was built with Bootstrap for ease of use, and the back-end utilized an Apache server with PHP and MySQL for database management. The system allows for remote monitoring and control, making it a versatile tool for smart home applications.
